### ADDRESS BOOK
The application ***Address Book*** allows to create digital *address books* for diverse users. Each user can add new contacts to his/her *address book*, edit them, delete, get them displayed, search for specific contacts by information stored in them. The following information can be stored in an *address book* for each contact:

1. Name (obligatory): name of the contact (can be only one).
2. Birthday (optional): the birthday date of the contact (can be only one).
3. Phone number(s) (optional): one or multiple phone numbers belonging to the contact.
4. E-mail(s) (optional): one or multiple e-mails belonging to the contact.
5. Address (optional): the address of the contact (can be only one).

Name and birthday are represented by one token only. In case of phone numbers, e-mails, each phone number/e-mail is one token. The address can consist of multiple tokens.
